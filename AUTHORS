Fakeroot Next Generation was written by Shachar Shemesh, in his spare time
(such that there is). Fakeroot NextGen is a clean reimplementation, and no code
was taken from previous implementations. It is based on a completely different
technology, and therefor does not suffer from the other implementations
limitations (but probably has its own unique ones).

The idea behind fakeroot ng has been around long before it came around. The
first implementation, as far as we could find, is called "fakeroot". It can be
found at http://alioth.debian.org/projects/fakeroot/. It lists Joost Witteveen,
Clint Adams and Timo Savola as the authors. Its functionality, as well as its
limitations, have been the inspiration that brought fakeroot-ng to be.

The original fakeroot's limitations were also the trigger that brought another
project about. Called "fakechroot", written by Piotr Roszatycki, home dir at
http://fakechroot.alioth.debian.org/, it attempts to overcome one of fakeroot's
main limitation - its inability to catch the open(2) system call, and therefor
its inability to emulate the "chroot" environment. It does not, however, change
the core technology used, and therefor has limitations over how complete the
environment is. It is hoped that as fakeroot-ng progresses, we can eliminate
all of the limitations.
